# Classification-on-Imbalanced-Data.

This project delves into the realm of machine learning to tackle the challenge of predicting insurance claim frequency, particularly focusing on handling imbalanced datasets. Leveraging Python and various libraries such as scikit-learn and seaborn, the project encompasses a comprehensive workflow from data analysis to model training and evaluation. Key steps include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, addressing class imbalance through oversampling techniques, and training a Random Forest classifier to predict claim status. The project also emphasizes the importance of feature selection and utilizes visualizations to enhance the interpretation of model performance metrics. By providing insights and techniques for handling imbalanced data, the project aims to contribute to the domain of insurance risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
